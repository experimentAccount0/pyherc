.. itemimage:: healing potion

Potions of healing are used to soothe and heal pains and damage of their user.
Effect of healing potion is usually gradual and it takes a while for the full
benefit to be received.

Most of the healing potions can not properly function if the user has been
poisoned. Two mixtures will interact and prevent healing from taking effect.

Poison
------
There are various poisons that will harm person coming into contact with them.
Some are weak, only dealing small amount of damage, while some can kill almost
instantly. If the poisoning does not kill the character, it will usually heal
over time. The most notable exception to this are poisons extracted from Lotus
flowers. These poisons will deal damage until the victim succumbs and dies.

Weapons
=======

Whip of Ashmque
---------------
.. itemimage:: whip of ashmque

From the Tome of Um'bano:

  *The whip of Ashmque is a horrendous weapon. Thong of the whip is made of 
  blackened links of steel and an eternal flame is burning around it. Only the
  strongest of men can even try to wield it because of the heavy construction.
  It is said that the whip of Ashmque was forged at the dawn of ages by 
  demon smith Ashmque.*

Tomes
*****
Mankind has had the urge to make sense of their surroundings and record their
findings in writing. Numerous tomes exists, some more known that others.

Tome of Um'bano
===============
History of Tome of Um'bano is shrouded in shadows and no complete copy of the
tome exists. Pages of the tome are thin sheets of metal. Because no complete
copy is known to exist, the exact number of pages is unknown.
