Armour
******
Robes
=====
.. image:: images/robes.png

Simple robes are favoured by spell casters. They do not hinder magical
abilities and strong wizards are more than capable of deflecting attacks
anyway.

Leather armour
==============
.. image:: images/leather_armour.png

Armour made of hardened leather. While it offers only meager protection, it
allows the wearer to move very swiftly.

Chainmail
=========
.. image:: images/chainmail.png

Armour made of countless interlocking metal rings. Somewhat heavier than
leather armour.

Scale mail
==========
.. image:: images/scale_mail.png

Scale mail is made of interlocking scales, in a similar manner to chainmail.
It offers better protection, while being heavier and harder to move around
with.

Plate mail
==========
.. image:: images/plate_mail.png

Ultimate solution for protection. Heavy plates cover wearer from head to toe,
offering great protection against attacks.

Potions

Holy water
----------

Healing potion
--------------
Potions of healing are used to soothe and heal pains and damage of their user.
Effect of healing potion is usually gradual and it takes a while for the full
benefit to be received.

Most of the healing potions can not properly function if the user has been
poisoned. Two mixtures will interact and prevent healing from taking effect.

Poison
------
There are various poisons that will harm person coming into contact with them.
Some are weak, only dealing small amount of damage, while some can kill almost
instantly. If the poisoning does not kill the character, it will usually heal
over time. The most notable exception to this are poisons extracted from Lotus
flowers. These poisons will deal damage until the victim succumbs and dies.

Weapons
=======

Whip of Ashmque
---------------
From the Tome of Um'bano:

  *The whip of Ashmque is a horrendous weapon. Thong of the whip is made of 
  blackened links of steel and an eternal flame is burning around it. Only the
  strongest of men can even try to wield it because of the heavy construction.
  It is said that the whip of Ashmque was forged at the dawn of ages by 
  demon smith Ashmque.*
