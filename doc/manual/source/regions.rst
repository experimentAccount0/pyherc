Ruins under city of Herculeum reach deep and far. Nobody has really explored
all the sections and discovered all the secrets. Here are written accounts of
the places discovered so far.

*********
Catacombs
*********
Catacombs are located right beneath the surface under the city of Herculeum.
They are mostly inhabited by regular cave dwelling creatures.

Rat (Rattus rattus)
===================
Common sight at the upper levels of the dungeon. Not very dangerous alone, but 
can be dangerous to lonely adventurer or when appearing in packs.

Fire beetle
===========
Found deeper in the catacombs. This creature has adapted living in darkness by
producing light in its internal organs. Fighting them can give a nasty surprise
for unprepared, since their bite is strong and causes strong burning sensation.

Skeleton
========
Skeletons are people long dead that have been raised back to eternal realm with
powerful magic. They have been guarding silent halls and corridors of catacombs
for uncountable years. Skeletons often carry equipment they had when they were
still among living.

Skeleton are slow as they wander aimlessly in the catacombs, but as soon as
they sense blood of living human they will relentlesly pursue them.

*****
Crypt
*****
Located somewhere upper parts of the ruins is the crypt. Nobody who has ventured
deep inside has not returned, but rumours talk moving shadows that lure 
adventurers and eventually kill them.

Spider
======
Spider of huge size. These monsters stand almost as tall as human. They are not
particularly fast, but their poisoned attacks can quickly kill careless adventurer.
