Avoiding combat
***************
Underside of Herculeum is dangerous place and sometimes it is better be
careful than brave.

When an intelligent creature notices you, small ! is displayed on screen.
These creatures often start pursuing you.

When you manage to escape pursuin enemy, they might lose focus and small ?
is displayed on screen. Usually they return to their patrol after losing
sight of you.

Not all creatures are intelligent enough to act like this. They often attack
without warning and return to their regular behaviour as soon as the threat
is not within immediate reach.

*************
Using potions
*************
Some adventurers carry potions when they enter the dungeon and more potions
can be found from within. Using potion in correct time can make difference
between dying and surviving to run away.

Healing potions can help to mend damage suffered. They do not work 
instanteniously, but rather over time. Adventurer has to be informed how
much and how soon the potion he is carrying is able to help him and react
early enough. When you are about to die, it is usually too late to use potion.
