<h1>Regions<a class="headerlink" href="#regions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Ruins under city of Herculeum reach deep and far. Nobody has really explored
all the sections and discovered all the secrets. Here are written accounts of
the places discovered so far.</p>
<div class="section" id="catacombs">
<h2>Catacombs<a class="headerlink" href="#catacombs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Catacombs are located right beneath the surface under the city of Herculeum.
They are mostly inhabited by regular cave dwelling creatures.</p>
<div class="section" id="rat-rattus-rattus">
<h3>Rat (Rattus rattus)<a class="headerlink" href="#rat-rattus-rattus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Common sight at the upper levels of the dungeon. Not very dangerous alone, but
can be dangerous to lonely adventurer or when appearing in packs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fire-beetle">
<h3>Fire beetle<a class="headerlink" href="#fire-beetle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Found deeper in the catacombs. This creature has adapted living in darkness by
producing light in its internal organs. Fighting them can give a nasty surprise
for unprepared, since their bite is strong and causes strong burning sensation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="skeleton">
<h3>Skeleton<a class="headerlink" href="#skeleton" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Skeletons are people long dead that have been raised back to eternal realm with
powerful magic. They have been guarding silent halls and corridors of catacombs
for uncountable years. Skeletons often carry equipment they had when they were
still among living.</p>
<p>Skeleton are slow as they wander aimlessly in the catacombs, but as soon as
they sense blood of living human they will relentlesly pursue them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="crypt">
<h2>Crypt<a class="headerlink" href="#crypt" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Located somewhere upper parts of the ruins is the crypt. Nobody who has ventured
deep inside has not returned, but rumours talk moving shadows that lure
adventurers and eventually kill them.</p>
<div class="section" id="spider">
<h3>Spider<a class="headerlink" href="#spider" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Spider of huge size. These monsters stand almost as tall as human. They are not
particularly fast, but their poisoned attacks can quickly kill careless adventurer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="crimson-lair">
<h2>Crimson Lair<a class="headerlink" href="#crimson-lair" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is rumoured that very deep caverns under city of Herculeum hide Crimson Lair.
The Tome of Um&#8217;bano reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>In the ancient times, old evil ruled over the land and terrorized everything.
Kingdoms were drowned in fire and destroyed by demon, Crimson Jaw. Only when
seven sages combined their powers, they could overcome him. But Crimson Jaw
was too strong to be destroyed completely and his spirit had to be bound and
trapped. Crimson Lair is his final resting place, where seals of seven sages
keep him imprisoned.</em></div></blockquote>
