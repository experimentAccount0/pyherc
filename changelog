Release 0.15
============

 * Items can have active effects
 * Healing animation fixed
   Previously triggering healing animation caused game to throw exceptions
   and write debug-log on console.
 * Damage to different body parts
   Damage can be targeted to different body parts. By default, this is "torso".
   Some armour grant character partial or full protection against damage that
   is targeted to a specific body part. For example, boots protect against
   damage targeting "feet".
 * Multiple traps can be placed in same location
 * Caltrops trap added
 * Mage renamed to master engineer
 * Nasty setup warning were fixed
   Previously some Hy only packages were listed as python packages in setup.py
   This caused warnings during packaging.
 * Items dropped in pit disappear
   Previously they would just float in the air and player could even pick them
   up. Now a trap is notified if an item is dropped into and and it can deal
   with the situation to best of its abilities. Default action is to do
   nothing.
 * #s reader macro was added to help creating multiline strings
 * Fungi undergoes mitosis only when it's located in room
   Preventing fungi from entering corridors effectively contains them inside
   a single room and gives player some breathing space.
 * Boots were added
   Characters can now wear boots that protect their feet. In addition to that,
   some boots grant additional abilities to characters.
